## FEB
### Data Management for Open and Reproducible Omics Research Workshop (3 days)
Foundational training aims to introduce participants to planning an omics project to ensure reproducibility and openness as vital principles for modern research. Training on the responsible use of the *icipe* server will also be emphasized.

**Audience:** 
Life science researchers involved or interested in omics research, people involved with genomic data management.

**Prerequisite:** None

**Content:**
- Project Organization and Management for Omics projects
- Introduction to Bioinformatics
- Introduction to Linux command line
- Responsible use of _icipe_ Bioinformatics resources and services  responsibly (HPC usage)
- Open science (FAIR Data and metadata management) and Reproducible Bioinformatics Research 
- Introduction to data backup and version control (e.g Git and GitHub)

## MARCH
### RNA-Seq (Transcriptomic) Analysis (One Week)
**Audience:** 
A one-week training for life science doctoral candidates, MSc students, and research fellows handling transcriptomic data. We intend to demonstrate pipelines for handling Omic datasets (sourced from various sequencing platforms such as ONT, Illumina, and PacBio). Also RNA-seq datasets of model and non-model organisms will be considered. The emphasis will also be on project management. Carpentries Resources and MBBU design pipelines will be used in training.

**Prerequisite:** Basic Knowledge on Bash and R

**Content:**
- Introduction to RNA-seq (RNA extraction, mRNA enrichment, Sequencing, Bioinformatics Analysis (Small RNAs, mRNAs))
- 

## APRIL 
### Microbiome Analysing (One Week)
This can be a one-week training that targets data analysis using R studio, where we will also emphasise on project management. We'll host this in collaboration with statistics. We could also make use of Carpentries Resources, design.
