## April-May
### Genome Assembly and Annotation Hackathon (3rd April - 31st May)
**Audience:** 
Two month Hackathon for life science doctoral candidates, MSc students, Undergraduate students and research fellows interested in handling genome reads data. 
We intend to generate a pipeline for assemblying (ONT/Illumina/PacBio) reads. The emphasis will also be on selection of tools needed for assembly and annotation. We look forward to also automate the workflow in Nextflow. (There is a possibility of writing a manuscript and review paper on genome assembly).

**Prerequisite:** Basic Knowledge on Bash, Python, and R

**Content:**
- TBD
- 

## May-July 
### Introduction to Bioinformatics (Three Months)
The course aims to provide an introduction to the field of bioinformatics, with a focus on important bioinformatics tools, and resources. The course aims to use a combination of theoretical and practical sessions in order for participants to gain practical experience in using various tools and resources.
The course content and outline is prepared by [H3ABioNet](https://www.h3abionet.org/categories/introduction-to-bioinformatics-training-2022) and will be facilitated by instructors from _icipe_ [MBBU unit](https://mbbu.github.io/). The application for applicants are expected to begin in April and Workshop to begin in May. Exact dates will be communicated.

**Audience:**

**Prerequisite:** Basic Knowledge on Bash and R


**Content:**
>
  - Explain the use of bioinformatics
  - Name the key bioinformatics techniques and tools
  - Locate important biological databases and retrieve data
  - Use selected tools effectively to run specific bioinformatics analyses
  - Understand the strengths and limitations of the various techniques
