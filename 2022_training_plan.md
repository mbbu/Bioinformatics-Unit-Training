## 2022 Bioinformatics Training Plan


# Feb - May 2022
## Cohort 5 Interns Induction to Bioinformatics
In the internship program, we have a two weeks curriculum to train the new incoming interns on primary and general bioinformatics skills.

# July  2022
## Machine learning for genomics
This module is designed to introduce learners to machine learning and its application in genomics.
```
- Introduction to machine learning
- ML models (classification and regression)
- Building a model, evaluation and interpretation
- Application in genomics
```
This will develop a foundation for learners interested in deep learning.

This is a closed training designed for EANBiT scholars to improve their skillset and prepare them for their masters projects
```
- Version control and collaborative development (Git & GitHub & Slack etc.)
- Advanced Scripting
- Biological databases and API
- Containerisation and deployment (Docker and Singularity)
- Reproducibility and package management: workflow languages (Nextflow, Snakemake and Conda/Mamba)
- Specialised databases (VectorBase, EupathDB) and APIs
- Phylogenomics (Visualization and Annotation)
- Metagenomics (16S and Whole-genome shotgun sequencing) 
- Machine Learning and modelling for genomic data
```


# October 2022  
## HPC Usage and Best practices
Targets researchers using the HPC in the institution to provide information about the HPC and its usage. 
```
