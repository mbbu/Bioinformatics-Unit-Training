# # Bioinformatics Unit – icipe Annual Training Schedule 2020

The unit aims to develop rolling training schedules in bioinformatics to target internal and external participants capacity building. We will put together materials to facilitate the trainings.


## FEB: Last Week
### [Data Management for Open and Reproducible Genomics Research Workshop](https://github.com/mbbu/Reproducible_Genomics_Project) (2 days)
This is a foundational training, which aims to introduce participants to considerations in planning a genomics project to ensure reproducibility and openness as vital principles for modern research.

**Audience:** Life science researchers involved or interested in genomics research, people involved with genomic data management, no prerequisite 
>
    • Introduction to bioinformatics (Data, Central dogma of Mol Bio, Online resources, NGS tech)
    • Organising a genomic project workspace (Data Management Plan)
    • Open and reproducible Bioinformatics research (Data tidiness, Frictionless Data tools)
    • Introduction to data backup and version control (Git and GitHub, Pipeline tools)

## MARCH
### Survey and Research Data Management with REDCap (End of March)
We have the H3Africa meeting, where *icipe* will host the fellows training. We are planning for REDCap training at the end of March. This will cover:
>
    - Why REDCap?
    - How to use REDCap for surveys
    - Setting up robust surveys (We need to find a trainer on this)
    - Research data management


## APRIL - One Week
### R for reproducible research and statistical analysis
This can be a one-week training that targets data analysis using R studio, where we will also emphasise on project management.We'll host this in collaboration with statistics. We could also make use of Carpentries Resources, design. 

## Since this is running at the same time we have the EANBiT RT, we mayhave to skip, or find a partner to host
### Introduction to Bioinformatics Training (IBT) 
H3ABioNet‘s Introduction to Bioinformatics course (IBT) provides an introduction to the field of bioinformatics, with a focus on important bioinformatics tools and resources.  It is delivered over a period of 3 months, through a combination of distance, face to face and onlne learning. During face to face contact sessions, classrooms meet virtually to discuss the session’s content with each other facilitated by a trainer and teaching assistants.  The course combines theoretical and practical sessions to allow participants to gain practical experience in using various tools and resources.
**Date:** 04 May – 31 July 2020; Every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:30 CAT to 14:30 CAT.

**Prerequisites / Audience:** A basic background/understanding of of biochemistry and/or genetics.

## MAY?
### One-Week Intermediate Bioinformatics Training?
This is designed to cater for ICIPE partners who are not part of the 5-week Residential Training.

**Audience:** Postgraduates students from partner instituitions. 
>
    - Version control and collaborative development (Git & Github & Slack etc.)
    - Metagenomics (16S and Whole-genome shotgun sequencing) 
    - Specialised databases (VectorBase, EupathDB) and APIs
    - Data Management for Open and Reproducible Genomics Research

## JUNE - JULY
### EANBiT Residential Training Course (6 weeks)
This training aims at strengthening bioinformatics technical capacity and skills among the participants; preparing them to work as bioinformaticians and to become project ready so that they have the necessary skills to offer bioinformatics support in projects they are attached to.

**Audience:** Postgraduates ++ with familiarity to computing/programming and/or life science background
>

    • Specialised databases (VectorBase, EupathDB) and APIs
    • Phylogenomics (Visualization and Annotation)
    • Metagenomics (16S and Whole-genome shotgun sequencing) 
    • Machine Learning and modelling for big data (fuzzy strings, HMM)

## AUGUST - OCTOBER
### H3ABioNet: Intermediate 16S rRNA Microbiome Training Course
The course aims to provide training to enable participants to gain the knowledge and skills to perform 16S rRNA microbiome data analyses using a variety of bioinformatics methods and tools.

**Audience:** Life science researchers involved or interested in genomics data analysis, no prerequisite 
>
    • Introduction to the Linux command line/intro to R
