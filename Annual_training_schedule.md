# Bioinformatics Unit – icipe Annual Training Schedule 2020
## MARCH
### Data Management for Open and Reproducible Genomics Research Workshop (2 days)
This is a foundational training, which aims to introduce participants to considerations in planning a genomics project to ensure reproducibility and openness as vital principles for modern research.
**Audience:** Life science researchers involved or interested in genomics research, people involved with genomic data management, no prerequisite 
>
    • Introduction to bioinformatics (Data; Central dogma of Mol Bio, Online resources, NGS tech)
    • Organizing a genomic project workspace (Data Management Plan)
    • Open and reproducible Bioinformatics research (Data tidiness, Frictionless Data tools)
    • Introduction to data backup and version control (Git and GitHub, Pipeline tools)
## JULY - AUGUST
### EANBiT Residential Training Course (6 weeks)
This training aims at strengthening bioinformatics technical capacity and skills among the participants; preparing them to work as bioinformaticians and to become project ready so that they have the necessary skills to offer bioinformatics support in projects they are attached to.
**Audience:** Postgraduates ++ with familiarity to computing/programming and/or life science background
>
    • Version control and collaborative development (Git & Github & Slack etc.)
    • Advanced Scripting
    • Biological databases and API
    • Gene models and annotation
    • Reproducibility and package management: workflow languages (CWL, Snakemake, Conda)
    • Specialized databases (VectorBase, EupathDB) and APIs
    • Phylogenomics (Visualization and Annotation)
    • Metagenomics (16S and Whole genome shotgun sequencing) 
    • Machine Learning and modeling for big data (fuzzy strings, HMM)
## AUGUST - OCTOBER
### H3ABioNet: Intermediate 16S rRNA Microbiome Training Course
The course aims to provide training to enable participants to gain the knowledge and skills to perform 16S rRNA microbiome data analyses using a variety of bioinformatics methods and tools.
**Audience:** Life science researchers involved or interested in genomics data analysis, no prerequisite 
>
    • Introduction to the Linux command line / intro to R
    • Introduction to the microbiome and study design – why 16S?
    • Sample collection, extraction and library prep for 16S NGS analyses
    • 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing bioinformatics pipeline: the theory
    • 16S analysis pipeline - QC, ASV picking, taxonomic classification and alignment metagenomeSeq (among others)
    • Downstream analysis in R - using the packages phyloseq, NMF, vegan,
## DECEMBER
### Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop (4 days)
This workshop aims to teach data management and analysis for genomics research including: best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command-line utilities, use of command-line tools to analyse sequence quality and perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing.
**Audience:** Life science researchers involved or interested in genomics data analysis, no prerequisite 
>
    • Project organisation and management
    • Introduction to command line interface
    • Data wrangling and processing
    • Introduction to cloud computing
